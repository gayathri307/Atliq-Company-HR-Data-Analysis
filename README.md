### Problem Statement:
Atliq Company seeks to analyze HR data spanning three months to gain insights into employee performance and attendance patterns. The primary objective is to understand employee attendance trends, including presence, absences, sick leave, half-days, and work-from-home statistics. By delving into this data, the company aims to optimize workforce management strategies and improve overall efficiency.

### Task List:
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Gather three months of real HR data.
   - Cleanse and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
   - Export the cleaned data from SQL for further analysis.

2. **DAX Calculation:**
   - Create DAX measures to calculate metrics such as presence percentage, absence percentage, sick leave count, total working days, and work-from-home percentage.
   - Develop DAX functions to streamline the calculation process and ensure accuracy.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze employee attendance patterns based on starting weekdays and ending weekdays.
   - Assess the distribution of presence, absences, sick leave, and half-days.
   - Determine the proportion of employees working from home versus office-based.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Create tables displaying presence percentages for different starting and ending weekdays.
   - Generate visualizations illustrating the distribution of sick leave across weekdays.
   - Visualize the percentage of attendance, work-from-home time, and sick leave over the three-month period using area charts.
   - Implement slicers for filtering data by months to enable dynamic exploration.

5. **Insights Generation:**
   - Extract insights regarding employee attendance trends and patterns.
   - Identify high-absence days or recurring absenteeism patterns.
   - Assess the effectiveness of work-from-home policies.
   - Evaluate individual employee performance based on attendance metrics.

### Learnings in this Project:
1. **HR Data Analysis Techniques:**
   - Understanding attendance metrics and their significance in workforce management.
   - Techniques for analyzing employee absenteeism and presence patterns.

2. **DAX Calculations:**
   - Mastery of DAX functions for calculating complex metrics such as presence percentage and sick leave count.
   - Applying DAX measures effectively to derive actionable insights from HR data.

3. **Data Visualization Skills:**
   - Creating informative and visually appealing visualizations to communicate HR insights effectively.
   - Leveraging slicers and filters for interactive data exploration.

4. **Workforce Optimization Strategies:**
   - Understanding the impact of attendance patterns on overall productivity and efficiency.
   - Identifying areas for improvement in workforce management policies and practices.
